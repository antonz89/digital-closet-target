Digital Closet app can display Items entered manually as carousel images and an ordered list. Select an Item, Color, Price, Immage (included in pics folder), and click Submit.

It can also display Cards in the Search Target section with information about items searched in the Search Target row. I am using target api.

Currently, I limited Cards number to 5 items. After you click <Search> button, give 5-10 seconds for API to respond To review my app you can search target:

Shirt Black - will create 3 cards 
T-shirt White - will create 2 cards 

To add items from Search section to your closet, click a little + button located inside the card.

I left multiple comments in the main.js file that will explain things more clearly.
